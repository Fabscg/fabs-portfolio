The six team members divided the work to   make this amazing page that enables users to type a musician's name and then several songs from that artist appear. Once a song is selected, the lyrics appear. Alternatively, a user can type the song title and the lyrics will show up. This site is good for singers who want to reproduce music by other artists, or for music enthusiasts who want to learn their favourite songs. I was responsible for the front-end, so I used flexbox in order to make it functional and responsive, too. We used two different APIs (iTunes and lyrics.ovh), HTML, CSS and JavaScript."

Developing this page got me even more interested coding, and more than anything, helped me to get into JavaScript. There is HTML, CSS and JavaScript."

Dependencies installed are express-sessions, express-handlebars, MySQL, Sequelize, dotenv and connect-session-sequelize for the DB."
